git gud is a wrapper command line interface (CLI) for git. git gud takes your mistakes and errors and automagically retrieves relevant StackOverflow answers right to your terminal.

## What it does
```shell
gud [git command arguments]
```
git gud wraps around the git cli commands and only requires you to write the arguments in as if you were doing normal git commands.
