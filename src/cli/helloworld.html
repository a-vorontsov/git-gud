<p>This looks like a broken installation of Git, I'd recommend to reinstall (on Ubuntu, this would be via <code>sudo apt-get install git</code>). The <code>pull</code> command is implemented as a shell script called <code>git-pull</code> located in the path returned by <code>git --exec-path</code>. You might want to check if the file is there.</p>
